Sources:

- driver.cc -- Runs the main program by instantiating a FlexSample
  object
- flexsample.cc -- Creates a Flexsample object that reads a file
  containing packet attributes, one per line, and performs sampling
  according to the configurations specified
- the confs/ directory: contains configuration files for different kinds
  of sampling, such as for DDoS, portscan, etc (see paper)
- conditions.cc -- implements config parsing 
- sblookuptable.cc -- implements the sampling budget lookup table
  (described in the paper)
- cbf.cc --- implements a counting bloom filter array (as in the paper)


How to use it for your own traces.

The input data files are in a form like this:

srcip|srcport|dstip|dstport|prot|flowsizepkts|flowsizebytes
143.215.129.26|34234|222.165.99.143|59323|17|1|30
143.215.15.171|80|203.87.87.218|1868|6|1|40
143.215.129.26|34014|82.32.82.176|22312|17|1|30
143.215.130.27|53|207.58.180.57|47401|17|1|133
143.215.143.4|53|217.107.222.76|33504|17|1|108
143.215.143.4|53|202.108.33.44|14883|17|12|1525
200.57.214.10|2204|143.215.15.199|447|17|1|102
190.188.132.9|3692|143.215.15.199|447|17|1|103

The first line specifies what the fields are, and you use the same field
name specifications (e..g, "flowsizepkts") in your config file.
Flexsample will pick out the appropriate field from the data file and
construct various tuples correctly. Look through some of the configs in
the confs/ directory to get an idea of how the tuples and conditions are
specified.
